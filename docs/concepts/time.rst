    ⏳ **Please note**: For every attribute describing a span of time, you may decide to use one of the following formats:

    - an easily readable notation with English time units "h" for hours, "min" for minutes, "s" for seconds and "ms" for milliseconds; for example: ``3h20min`` or ``100ms``
    - the `ISO 8601 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations>`__ notation for durations: ``PT3H20M0.1S``
    - the C# TimeSpan format: ``03:20:0.1``

    This choice has no further technical implications and is merely an expression of personal taste.
